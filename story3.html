            Studies show that by 2030 30% of the total workforce will be made up of Generation Z, as this generation is
            set to grow rapidly and shows unique focuses gaining a deeper understanding as to their character traits,
            motivations, and value regarding work - will pave the way towards building a happier and healthier
            workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a generation, Gen Z are characterised as having a strong uncompromising sense of what they want out of
            their first job and workplace culture, in fact, they are more likely to seek out a new position should their
            expectation levels not be adequately met by their employers [1]. Data gathered from LinkedIn shows that Gen
            Z employees in the United States are transitioning jobs nearly 40% more than previous years, at a rate that
            is double that of millennial employees [2].
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Here are our top tips to attracting and retaining Gen Z employees</h2>
            Demonstrate your dedication to workplace diversity and inclusion
            Creating a business environment that celebrates diversity and respects individuality is a big draw card for
            the new generation of employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a large focus being placed onto neurodiversity recently, creating an inclusive and supportive workplace
            environment for attracting neurodiverse Gen Z employees is important in demonstrating an organisation's true
            commitment to diversity and inclusion. Find out how organisations can create a supportive environment for
            neurodiverse employees here, and gain a deeper understanding on what the neurodiverse spectrum means here.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Collaboration and Communication are key</h2>
            This generation grew up in the age of social media and like to be constantly connected to the people they
            work with, social interaction is highly valued and organisations will need to understand this when looking
            to hire Gen Z employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to keep in mind that this communication and connection does not need to take place
            face-to-face with many employees being happy to connect with their colleagues over video and phone
            conferences with instant messaging apps keeping daily communications instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            To calm any anxieties around longevity within a role or the company at large, organisation leaders must
            ensure open and consistent communications with employees. Developing and implementing a strategy to ensure
            this includes updates on business developments to provide a sense of role security and longevity within the
            business.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Structured work-life balance</h2>
            As found in Deloitte’s 2023 Gen Z and Millennial Survey, 77% of Gen Z employees who are currently in remote
            or hybrid roles would consider looking for a new role if their employer required them to work on site
            full-time. With about 16% of these employees stating that they would immediately start looking for new work
            should this change be asked of them [3].
        </p>

        <p>
            These findings show how highly valued flexibility within a role is when creating a healthy work-life balance
            citing this structure allows for a positive impact on overall mental health [4] and a key consideration to
            attract and retain Gen Z employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Don’t be afraid of new technology</h2>
            Gen Z grew up not knowing what the time before social media, instant access to the internet and smartphones
            was like. A global survey shows that 98% of Gen Z's own a smartphone and half of those surveyed spend on
            average 10 hours a day using it [5].
        </p>

        <p>
            Based on this early adoption of technology, companies can greatly improve their chances of attracting and
            retaining new employees by providing them with access to the latest solutions. Providing access to
            productivity and project management apps, collaboration tools, and video conferencing services are all
            crucial to ensuring employees are productive and perform well.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Empathise with mental health needs</h2>
            Eight in ten Gen Zs identified mental health support and policies as a top factor when considering a
            potential employer, according to those surveyed in Deloitte’s 2023 Gen Z and Millennial Survey [6]. An
            organisation that shows a demonstrated commitment to supporting mental health in the workplace through
            offering access to a wellness platform, prioritising appropriate training for those in leadership positions,
            and de-stigmatise open communication around mental health are far more attractive to a potential Gen Z
            employee than one that doesn’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Offer the right benefits</h2>
            70% of Gen Z employees see private medical insurance as a ‘must-have’ benefit [7], much like the eight in
            ten Gen Zs we mentioned above who see mental health support and policies as a top factor when considering a
            potential employer, private medical insurance is a draw for this generation due to the extended waiting
            periods the NHS is currently experiencing.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this generation just entering the workforce, they are focused on creating a sustainable career focused
            on growth and see benefits as part of that growth. Offering a customised private medical insurance package
            that fits the needs of your employees is not just a benefit to them but a commitment to the productivity of
            the larger organisation. While wellness platforms, like Champion Health will assist with the preventative
            side of supporting employees wellness through tailored programmes created to support the individual needs of
            the user, proactive intervention is needed to ensure continued medical support. This is where a Healix
            Healthcare Trust can assist through proactively guiding employees to seek the assistance they need to
            continue to be healthy and happy in the workplace.
